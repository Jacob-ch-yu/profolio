					<h3 class = "tittle">How to Adapt to New Teaching Styles - Ryan Yu</h3>
					<p class ="introduction">Even though many people think MBA programs are about networking and getting a better opportunity for a job, we can’t discuss MBA life without academics. Each MBA program has unique core classes and numerous electives. Also, having a brisk discussion and sharing ideas in the classroom is another attractive feature of MBA classes. However, there are many difficulties too. Many professors cold-call students in the class or use the casing teach method with which international students are not familiar. We invite Ryan Yu, an MBA2 student from Harvard Business School, to share his academic experience with us.</p>
